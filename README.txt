The files in this repo are copies of those I used for the game ".LineÂ²" (dot line square), which can be downloaded for free on itch.io at the following link: https://bgt.itch.io/dotlinesquare

The game used the Unity engine, the code was written in C#, was made in early 2019 by myself and was based upon a classic pen + paper game.

The files are here more for demonstration, rather than for actual development at this point.
